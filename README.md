## Project Overview
This project is focused on detecting traffic cones in images and fitting boundary lines to demarcate the drivable path using OpenCV and scikit-learn. It demonstrates practical application of computer vision techniques in scenarios akin to autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Problem Statement
The main objective was to accurately detect red traffic cones in various lighting conditions and fit lines to suggest a viable path for vehicle navigation. The challenge involved ensuring that the lines are straight, appropriately placed relative to the detected cones, and adaptive to different scenarios without manual adjustment.

## Approach and Challenges

### Initial Setup
The project began with the implementation of image processing techniques to detect cones. Using the HSV color space was pivotal because it simplifies color filtering, which is crucial for identifying cones based on their distinct red color.

### Challenges Faced
- **Irregular Cone Detection**: Initially, the detection was inconsistent, especially under different lighting conditions.
- **Line Fitting Issues**: The lines fitted initially were not straight and sometimes overlapped the cones, which could misguide navigation.

### Solutions Implemented
- **Refining Color Thresholds**: Adjusted the HSV ranges to better accommodate varying lighting conditions, which stabilized cone detection accuracy.
- **Advanced Contour Filtering**: Implemented area-based filtering of contours to ignore small detections that could lead to errors in line fitting.
- **Robust Line Fitting with RANSAC**: Employed RANSACRegressor to fit lines, which is less sensitive to outliers. This approach helped in generating straighter lines.
- **Centroid Adjustment**: Before fitting the lines, the centroids of the detected cones were adjusted slightly outward (left or right depending on the side). This ensured that the fitted lines did not overlap with the cones and provided a clearer path.

## Outcomes and Improvements
The adjustments led to a more reliable detection of cones and the fitting of more accurate boundary lines. Future improvements could include implementing dynamic threshold adjustments based on real-time feedback from the environment, enhancing the systemâ€™s adaptability.
